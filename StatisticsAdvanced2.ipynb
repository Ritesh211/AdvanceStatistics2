        "Question 1: What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses (null and alternative), collecting sample data, and using probability theory to determine whether the evidence is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2: What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): A statement that there is no effect or no difference; it represents the status quo or baseline assumption. Example: \"The average test score = 50.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ or Ha): A statement that contradicts the null, suggesting that there is an effect or a difference. Example: \"The average test score ‚â† 50.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Key difference: The null assumes no change/relationship, while the alternative suggests the presence of change/relationship. Hypothesis testing evaluates whether data provides enough evidence to reject H‚ÇÄ in favor of H‚ÇÅ.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3: Explain the significance level in hypothesis testing and its role in deciding the outcome of a test.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The significance level (Œ±) is the threshold probability used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. Common choices are 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%).\n",
        "\n",
        "If the p-value ‚â§ Œ±, we reject H‚ÇÄ (evidence supports H‚ÇÅ).\n",
        "\n",
        "If the p-value > Œ±, we fail to reject H‚ÇÄ (not enough evidence against it).\n",
        "\n",
        "Role: It controls the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). For example, Œ± = 0.05 means we accept a 5% risk of incorrectly rejecting H‚ÇÄ.\n",
        "Question 4: What are Type I and Type II errors? Give examples of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Type I Error (False Positive): Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A medical test concludes a patient has a disease (reject H‚ÇÄ: ‚Äúno disease‚Äù) when they are actually healthy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Type II Error (False Negative): Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\n",
        "\n",
